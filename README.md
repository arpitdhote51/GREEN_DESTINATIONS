This project aims to analyze employee attrition and identify key factors influencing an employee's decision to leave the company. The dataset contains various attributes related to employee demographics, job roles, and work-life balance.

Objectives

Calculate Attrition Rate: Determine the percentage of employees who have left the company.

Analyze Key Factors: Investigate whether Age, Years at Company, and Income significantly impact attrition.

Perform Correlation Analysis: Identify relationships between key variables and attrition.

Visualize Trends: Use statistical plots to understand patterns in employee retention.

The dataset includes the following relevant columns:

Attrition (Yes/No) - Indicates whether an employee has left.

Age - Age of the employee.

YearsAtCompany - Number of years the employee has worked in the company.

Income (if available) - Salary or financial compensation details.

Additional factors such as Job Role, Department, Work-Life Balance, and Promotions.
